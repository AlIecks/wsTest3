                                    <p class="subtitle">So you are a well-rounded cash flow financial modeler. You have
                                        fair experience
                                        in
                                        modeling non-financial ventures. You are calm and confident. You victoriously
                                        solved
                                        any modeling task you faced before. The positive feedback you get from your
                                        clients
                                        only reinforces this stance.</p>

                                    <p>But life's full of surprises. And here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s piece of news: your
                                        next project
                                        is
                                        modeling a commercial bank. Yikes! You don&rsquo;t have FIG experience, but that
                                        does
                                        not
                                        seem to bother your client. Your first draft is expected in two weeks. The
                                        deadline
                                        is fast approaching.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        No worries, you say to yourself. I have a lot of experience to build upon. I
                                        probably start from projecting sales? Wait, a bank does not have sales? OK, it
                                        has
                                        income, then income it is. Then&hellip; what is <q>RWA</q>? Risk-weighted
                                        assets?
                                        Weighted
                                        how?
                                        Based on <q>Basel</q> recommendations? What are those? And yeah, my client also
                                        wants
                                        to
                                        see <q>LCR</q> and <q>NSFR</q> ratios (not a slightest idea what
                                        it is
                                        supposed
                                        to mean)
                                        calculated in the model and the corresponding met at all times. Damn, what do
                                        these
                                        mean? OK now, there&rsquo;re probably good tutorials written for just such an
                                        occasion?
                                        Hey, what do you mean <q>there aren&rsquo;t</q>? Hell, what a freaking mess!</p>

                                    <p>
                                        That&rsquo;s exactly the situation I found myself in back in the day. I was not
                                        the
                                        best
                                        one to take the project, but I was the only one. And I had to break through the
                                        lack
                                        of my understanding the hard way.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Surprisingly, today the situation does not look much better. Sure, there are
                                        decent
                                        materials on commercial banking (how there could not be?). And yet almost none
                                        of
                                        them are designed for or by modeling community &mdash; at least none that
                                        I&rsquo;m aware
                                        of.
                                        Yes, you have banking financial models, and books on regulation, and materials
                                        on
                                        valuation of financial companies. But if you need concise and up to the point
                                        quick
                                        start tutorial on banking for modelers &mdash; good luck finding it.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        That&rsquo;s what I undertook to fix. I put together a terse tutorial article to
                                        help
                                        non-FIG cash flow modelers quickly grasp the essentials of modeling commercial
                                        banks. I've encountered a lot of bumps along my way to do it at the time and
                                        trust
                                        me I don&rsquo;t wish you the same.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        So here&rsquo;s the deal. To get started, you need to get yourself acquainted
                                        with the
                                        three pillars of banking essentials: business model, regulation, and modeling
                                        aspects. That&rsquo;s what the article below will give you. As I will make
                                        clear,
                                        regulation plays a crucial role in banking modeling, so I pay a due attention to
                                        it
                                        &mdash; in both academic and practical terms. We&rsquo;ll cover Basel III in
                                        appropriate
                                        detail
                                        here.</p>


                                    <p>
                                        But if you think at this point, is it just another article on Basel regulation,
                                        then
                                        you are knocking on the wrong door. The real power of this tutorial is its
                                        practical
                                        orientation &mdash; we do everything in Excel! For starters, I will illustrate
                                        the
                                        calculation of key Basel III metrics and ratios (RWA, CAR,
                                        LR, LCR, NSFR). Then
                                        we&rsquo;ll move on to the heart of the tutorial: step-by-step building of a
                                        full-fledged
                                        commercial banking model meeting essential regulatory requirements. That&rsquo;s
                                        right:
                                        all underlying Excel files are part of the article. Theory and practice, all
                                        fused
                                        into a hands-on, ready-to-use quick-start guide.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As they used to say on TV, <q>But wait! There&rsquo;s more!</q>. Besides
                                        bit-by-bit
                                        development
                                        of Excel model complying with Basel III requirements, I introduce you to cash
                                        flow
                                        valuation of banks. Just like any other aspect of banking, its valuation is
                                        somewhat
                                        peculiar. But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll get you covered.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        After completing this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll have a strong foundation in
                                        modeling
                                        commercial banks. You&rsquo;ll be well equipped to build on it in any way as you
                                        project
                                        calls for.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Welcome to the journey! Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy it.</p>
